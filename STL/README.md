# STL

## Quantity to print

Beginning of each filename denotes the quantity of that part you need to print.

for example

1x_power_supply_box.stl means you should print one.

## Print settings

PETG is preferred but ABS will work fine as well

All models should be printed as oriented in the STL files

No supports are needed, for models that require support they are already baked in

30% infill, triangular or fast honeycomb for strength
3/3/2 top/bottom/perimeters
0.2mm layer height
